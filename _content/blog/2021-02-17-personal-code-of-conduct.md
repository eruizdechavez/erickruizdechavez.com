I am a big fan of having, following, and enforcing a Code of Conduct (CoC) in all projects where I participate. If by any chance they do not have one, I always seek to collaborate with the project mantainers to adopt one that aligns properly with their values. So far I have seen great results, we all grow together, and ensure a safe and civilized space for everyone.

I also recently got the idea of having a Personal Code of Conduct. If you think about it, many of us may already have one, although probably not written and publicly visible; you might call it your values, your ethics, etc., but in the end we like to align ourselves with it and strive to follow it.

This is why a few days ago I decided to adapt one of my favorite CoC, [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org) and today I am publishing it on my site as my [Personal CoC](/code-of-conduct/).

What do you think of this idea? Do you think it does not make sense? Would you adopt a similar Personal CoC?
