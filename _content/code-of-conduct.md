title: Code of Conduct
---

## My Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, I pledge to make my participation in any and all projects and communities a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Standards

Examples of behavior that you should **always** expect from me include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior you should **never** expect from me:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Responsibilities

I will always accept and follow the Code of Conduct of the projects and communities where I participate, and if there is no such Code of Conduct, I will do my best to recommend the project maintainers to institute, follow, and enforce one that aligns with their values.

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior in their projects and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action towards me in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject any of my comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban me temporarily or permanently for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces where I participate, and it also applies when I am representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the corresponding project team. If possible, I also encourage and appreciate to be notified of such behavior using [my contact form](/contact/).

All complaints I receive will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. I will maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
