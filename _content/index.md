Howdy üëãüèª, I am Erick.

I have experience in different technologies and programming languages like PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Less, Sass, MongoDB, MySQL, Web Servers, Web Services (REST, SOAP); to name some of them.

Even though I consider myself as a full-stack engineer, I've been focused mainly on the front end, working with frameworks like Angular and Ember.js.

I have a podcast where I talk with some friends and acquaintances every week and discuss different technical and non-technical topics. I enjoy helping others and sharing my experiences.

I am a big fan of automation, particularly when it comes to daily chores, using different tools like scripts and some utilities and macros.
