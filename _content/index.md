Howdy üëãüèª, I am Erick.

I have experience in different technologies and programming languages like PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Less, Sass, MongoDB, MySQL, Web Servers, Web Services (REST, SOAP); to name some of them.

I am a big fan of automation, particularly when it comes to daily chores, using different tools like scripts and some utilities and macros.
